## Introduction

Welcome to the Snake Game! This simple classic game allows you to control a snake and collect food to grow while avoiding collisions with the walls and yourself. This repository contains the code for the Snake Game implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Gameplay

The player controls a blue snake on a black game board. The objective is to navigate the snake to consume red food items that randomly appear. Each time the snake eats, it grows longer. The challenge is to keep the snake from running into the game board edges or into itself.

## Controls

- **Desktop:** Use the arrow keys to change the direction of the snake.
- **Mobile:** Swipe in the direction you want the snake to move.

## Visuals and Style

- The game has a clean, minimalistic interface with a snake skin pattern background.
- The snake is colored blue, and the food is red, providing a clear contrast against the black game board.
- A "Start New Game" button is prominently displayed at the center of the page.
